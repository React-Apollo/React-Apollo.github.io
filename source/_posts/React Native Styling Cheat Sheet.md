## Flexbox
| Name | Type | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| alignItems | [oneOf](#oneof) `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch` | `alignItems` aligns children in the cross direction. For example, if children are flowing vertically, `alignItems` controls how they align horizontally. It works like `align-items` in CSS, except the default value is `stretch` instead of `flex-start`. See https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/align-items/ for more detail. |
| alignSelf | [oneOf](#oneof) `auto`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch` | controls how a child aligns in the cross direction, overriding the `alignItems` of the parent. It works like `align-self` in CSS. See https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/align-self/ for more detail. |
| borderBottomWidth | [number](#number) | `borderBottomWidth` works like `border-bottom-width` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-bottom_width.asp for more details. |
| borderLeftWidth | [number](#number) | `borderLeftWidth` works like `border-left-width` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-bottom_width.asp for more details. |
| borderRightWidth | [number](#number) | `borderRightWidth` works like `border-right-width` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-right_width.asp for more details. |
| borderTopWidth | [number](#number) | `borderTopWidth` works like `border-top-width` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-top_width.asp for more details. |
| borderWidth | [number](#number) | `borderWidth` works like `border-width` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-width.asp for more details. |
| bottom | [number](#number) | `bottom` is the number of logical pixels to offset the bottom edge of this component. It works similarly to `bottom` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom for more details of how `top` affects layout. |
| flex | [number](#number) | In React Native `flex` does not work the same way that it does in CSS. `flex` is a number rather than a string, and it works according to the `css-layout` library at https://github.com/facebook/css-layout . When `flex` is a positive number, it makes the component flexible and it will be sized proportional to its flex value. So a component with `flex` set to 2 will take twice the space as a component with `flex` set to 1. When `flex` is 0, the component is sized according to `width` and `height` and it is inflexible. When `flex` is -1, the component is normally sized according `width` and `height`. However, if there's not enough space, the component will shrink to its `minWidth` and `minHeight`. |
| flexDirection | [oneOf](#oneof) `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, `column-reverse` | `flexDirection` controls which directions children of a container go. `row` goes left to right, `column` goes top to bottom, and you may be able to guess what the other two do. It works like `flex-direction` in CSS, except the default is `column`. See https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-direction/ for more detail. |
| flexWrap | [oneOf](#oneof) `wrap`, `nowrap` | `flexWrap` controls whether children can wrap around after they hit the end of a flex container. It works like `flex-wrap` in CSS. See https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-wrap/ for more detail. |
| height | [number](#number) | `height` sets the height of this component. It works similarly to `height` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_width.asp for more details. |
| justifyContent | [oneOf](#oneof) `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around` | `justifyContent` aligns children in the main direction. For example, if children are flowing vertically, `justifyContent` controls how they align vertically. It works like `justify-content` in CSS. See https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/j/justify-content/ for more detail. |
| left | [number](#number) | `left` is the number of logical pixels to offset the left edge of this component. It works similarly to `left` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/left for more details of how `left` affects layout. |
| margin | [number](#number) | Setting `margin` has the same effect as setting each of `marginTop`, `marginLeft`, `marginBottom`, and `marginRight`. |
| marginBottom | [number](#number) | `marginBottom` works like `margin-bottom` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin-bottom.asp for more details. |
| marginHorizontal | [number](#number) | Setting `marginHorizontal` has the same effect as setting both `marginLeft` and `marginRight`. |
| marginLeft | [number](#number) | `marginLeft` works like `margin-left` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin-left.asp for more details. |
| marginRight | [number](#number) | `marginRight` works like `margin-right` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin-right.asp for more details. |
| marginTop | [number](#number) | `marginTop` works like `margin-top` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin-top.asp for more details. |
| marginVertical | [number](#number) | Setting `marginVertical` has the same effect as setting both `marginTop` and `marginBottom`. |
| maxHeight | [number](#number) | `maxHeight` is the maximum height for this component, in logical pixels. It works similarly to `max-height` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_max-height.asp for more details. |
| maxWidth | [number](#number) | `maxWidth` is the maximum width for this component, in logical pixels. It works similarly to `max-width` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_max-width.asp for more details. |
| minHeight | [number](#number) | `minHeight` is the minimum height for this component, in logical pixels. It works similarly to `min-height` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_min-height.asp for more details. |
| minWidth | [number](#number) | `minWidth` is the minimum width for this component, in logical pixels. It works similarly to `min-width` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_min-width.asp for more details. |
| padding | [number](#number) | `padding` works like `padding` in CSS. It's like setting each of `paddingTop`, `paddingBottom`, `paddingLeft`, and `paddingRight` to the same thing. See http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp for more details. |
| paddingBottom | [number](#number) | `paddingBottom` works like `padding-bottom` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding-bottom.asp for more details. |
| paddingHorizontal | [number](#number) | Setting `paddingHorizontal` is like setting both of `paddingLeft` and `paddingRight`. |
| paddingLeft | [number](#number) | `paddingLeft` works like `padding-left` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding-left.asp for more details. |
| paddingRight | [number](#number) | `paddingRight` works like `padding-right` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding-right.asp for more details. |
| paddingTop | [number](#number) | `paddingTop` works like `padding-top` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding-top.asp for more details. |
| paddingVertical | [number](#number) | Setting `paddingVertical` is like setting both of `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom`. |
| position | [oneOf](#oneof) `absolute`, `relative` | `position` in React Native is similar to regular CSS, but everything is set to `relative` by default, so `absolute` positioning is always just relative to the parent. If you want to position a child using specific numbers of logical pixels relative to its parent, set the child to have `absolute` position. If you want to position a child relative to something that is not its parent, just don't use styles for that. Use the component tree. See https://github.com/facebook/css-layout for more details on how `position` differs between React Native and CSS. |
| right | [number](#number) | `right` is the number of logical pixels to offset the right edge of this component. It works similarly to `right` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/right for more details of how `right` affects layout. |
| top | [number](#number) | `top` is the number of logical pixels to offset the top edge of this component. It works similarly to `top` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/top for more details of how `top` affects layout. |
| width | [number](#number) | `width` sets the width of this component. It works similarly to `width` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_width.asp for more details. |
| zIndex | [number](#number) | `zIndex` controls which components display on top of others. Normally, you don't use `zIndex`. Components render according to their order in the document tree, so later components draw over earlier ones. `zIndex` may be useful if you have animations or custom modal interfaces where you don't want this behavior. It works like the CSS `z-index` property - components with a larger `zIndex` will render on top. Think of the z-direction like it's pointing from the phone into your eyeball. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index for more detail. |
